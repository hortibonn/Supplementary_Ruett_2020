# Model-based evaluation of management options in ornamental plant nurseries 

Decision Analysis in ornamental plant nurseries enables assessment of management options concerning fungal disease regulation. Implementation of management options in ornamental plant nurseries need to be accompanied by maintaining economic viability, determination of systems' uncertainties and factors that influence possible outcome distributions. Results of this approach facilitate decision support for heather producers that seek to implement noval management practices but are exposed to the risky nature of heather production. In addition, recommendations can be made to identify risks before making new decisions.
